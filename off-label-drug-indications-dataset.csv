The same patients are counted several times if they have several visits.We then stratified this 9-year dataset into three equal parts (2005–2007, 2008–2010, and 2011–2013) and examined the time trends in antipsychotic treatments during anxiety visits. We transformed the calendar years by subtracting 2005 from the year and dividing the results by 8. Thus, the transformed values were 0 for 2005 and 1 for 2013. The odds ratios associated with this transformed variable represent change in the odds of visits in which antipsychotic medication was prescribed across the entire study period (2005–2013). For example, an odds ratio of 2.0 denotes twice the odds that a visit included an antipsychotic at the end (2013) as compared with the start (2005) of the study period. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated from the multivariate logistic model with adjustment for age and sex. We repeated similar analysis to examine the trends in the use of selective FGA (i.e., flupenxiol and sulpiride) and individual SGA (i.e., clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone). (...) First-generation antipsychotics (FGA) use was more than that of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) use in patients with anxiety disorder through the 9-year period. Sulpiride and flupentixol were the two most common FGA in the treatment of anxiety disorder. Patients with specific anxiety disorder (post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder), female sex, younger age (age < 65 years), comorbidity with major depression or minor depression, antidepressants concurrent use, and visits to psychiatrists, medical centers and primary care were significantly more likely to take prescribed antipsychotics",Adults,1,0,,0,Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2019 Aug;73(8):501-507. doi: 10.1111/pcn.12861.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week trial in OCD, escitalopram (20 mg/day) was associated with an increase in response rate compared to placebo after 12 weeks.
